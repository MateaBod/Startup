                <h3>Believe</h3>
                <p>There is no such thing as a perfect time to start a business.
                    The stars are unlikely to align in your favor so that everything goes smoothly,
                    but you may either see this as a barrier to getting started or as a motivator to get started now.
                    There will be many challenges to overcome, but believing in yourself and your work will push you and
                    help to realize it will pay off.</p>

            <div id="cell-2">
                <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
                <p>Consider how will you execute out your business concept when you have come up with one. A business
                    model comes into picture at this point.
                    The business model is a plan for how you will make money from your customers while also providing
                    value to them. The next step is to figure out your target market. Who are you going to serve, in
                    other words?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cell-3">
                <h3>Work hard</h3>
                <p>Every achievement begins with a decision to try. To achieve and get a startUp going, time and a lot
                    of work is required. So, get ready to roll up your
                    sleeves and get started. Hard work was always the key to success.</p>
