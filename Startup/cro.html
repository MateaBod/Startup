                <h5>AirBnB</h5>
                <p>This is a story of three men who grew their business from renting mattresses to a $10 billion
                    company.
                    Designers Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia couldn't afford their San Francisco apartment rent in 2007.
                    Because the city's hotels were all booked up for a design conference in San Francisco, they came up
                    with the idea of renting out three airbeds on their living room floor and cooking breakfast for
                    their visitors.
                    They created a simple blog and rented to three people (two men and one woman) for $80 each.
                    They contacted Nathan Blecharczyk, a former flatmate and computer science graduate, to construct the
                    website and join the firm after a little success and product market fit.</p>

                <h5>Facebook</h5>
                <p>Mark Zuckerberg, a 19-year-old Harvard sophomore, developed an internal social networking site for
                    Harvard students.
                    The site quickly grew in popularity among students, and it began to spread its reach to other
                    campuses.
                    The site relocated to Palo Alto, California, in 2004 and received its first investment from PayPal
                    co-founder Peter Thiel.
                    Shortly after it was one of the most popular social media and it still is today.</p>

                <h5>Uber</h5>
                <p>Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were grumbling about the numerous horrible things we all have to
                    deal with in
                    life after a conference in Paris, including finding a cab. The two were already brainstorming ways
                    to discover cars at the right place,
                    in the right time, the next thing you know an app called Uber was developed and it conquered the
                    market.</p>

                <h5>Snapchat</h5>
                <p>Three college friends, Evan Spiegel, Reggie Brown, and Bobby Murphy, were putting their
                    entrepreneurial skills to the test. "I wish these images I'm sending this girl would disappear,"
                    Reggie commented casually during a conversation.
                    Evan referred to it as a'million dollar idea' shortly after. They worked on the app for a while
                    before
                    launching it under the name Picaboo. However, following a fight with Reggie, Evan and Bobby asked
                    him to
                    leave and renamed the company Snapchat.</p>
